## What I Learned

In the process of creating this dice game, I learned and implemented several key concepts and techniques:

- HTML structure and layout: I used HTML to create the basic structure of the game, including headings, buttons, and images.

- CSS styling: I applied CSS styles to customize the appearance of the game elements, such as fonts, colors, and layouts.

- JavaScript logic: I utilized JavaScript to implement the game's logic, including generating random dice values, changing dice images, determining the winner, and playing sound effects.

- DOM manipulation: I used JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), selecting and modifying elements on the webpage dynamically.

- Event handling: I added event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicking the "START" button to initiate the game.

- Audio playback: I incorporated audio files and used JavaScript's `Audio` object to play sound effects based on the game's outcome.

- Page refreshing: I implemented a function to reload the page when the "START" button is clicked, allowing the game to be played again.
